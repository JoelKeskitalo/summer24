            <h1>In the grim darkness of the far future... <br>there is only <span id="war">War.</span></h1>
            <p class="content-text">It has been 6 months since the galaxy-spanning civil war known as the Horus Heresy concluded, culminating in a devestating final battle on Humanitys birthplanet: Terra.<br><br>
                There will be years before even a reliable estimation of the damage done to the Imperium as a result of this conflict can be verified, yet the conflict is not truly over. As Horus fell in his titanic battle against the Emperor of Mankind it was left to his disciples to rally whatever forces they could and initate a full scale retreat of all traitor forces.

                Abaddon The Despoiler of the Sons of Horus legion, are seen by many in the remaining traitor legions as the unquestionable successor and thus command the largest unified force of the traitor legions. <br><br>
                However, the prospect of launching any sort of renewed offensive against the Capital World is far from Abaddon's mind. In a headlong retreat, simply surviving, yet alone going on any sort of attack, is far from certain.<br><br>
                As disillusionment, regret, anger and a host of other emotions pour out of the surviving traitor legions... the Dark Gods are fed, but unity is lost. Abaddon has not only Imperium Forces hunting him, The Space Marines amongst his midst pose as much of a challenge.<br><br>
